# Team-15

**Currently, the Dev branch is set to default. This is correct as this Dev branch should be treated as the main for our repository**
**Vice versa, our main branch is intended to be our actual developmental branch that was used for a majority of the project. Sorry for the inconvenience.**

The Team-15 GitHub REPOSITORY:
Hello! This is the repository for Team-15 in CSC 3380. This repository consists of every branch and file that is associated with our game, "GYMRAT". We have developed this game over the course of around 3-4 months using Unity in C#. We used the Unity version 2022.3.46f1 to create the game and used VSCode to create scripts for the game in C#. The "GYMRAT" game is a platformer-fighter that consists of three levels and two bosses! We have created many folders and sub-folders in the Unity editor listed above to neatly organize where each asset or script is for the game. If you are looking to play the game to research and see how to further develop the game, please read the instructions below!
